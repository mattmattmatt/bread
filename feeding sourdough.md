# How to care for your sourdough

## How often should I feed my sourdough?

When the sourdough is kept at room temperature, it should be fed every 12 hours. A few hours more or less are okay, but that's the goal.

When the sourdough is kept in the fridge, it should be fed once a week. Check after five days if all is still good. Leave at room temperature for an hour or so after feeding and put it back in the fridge.

A healthy sourdough at room temeprature should start producing bubbles shortly after being fed.

If the sourdough begins to separate into layers, one liquid, one thick, then it's underfed. Stir everything back together and feed as lined out below.

## How do I feed my sourdough?

1. Stir sourdough into homgoneous mass.
2. Discard all sourdough but let's say `50g` / `1 cup` (keep more if you need more).
3. Add `50g` / `50ml` / `1 cup` of room temperature water (adjust if you kept more sourdough).
4. Stir.
5. Add `50g` / `2 cups` of wheat all-purpose flour (adjust again if your measures differ).
6. Stir thoroughly (a small spoon will do) until homgoneous mass, make sure no dry dough is sticking to corners of container.
7. Done. Fuck yeah.
